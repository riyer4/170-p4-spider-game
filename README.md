Ria:

I forgot if we need to show all four at once or all four in different scenes.

If the latter is the case, then we need to duplicate Play.js four times with different names and update index.html + the scenes in main.js, plus with diff buttons that allow players to go to separate screens

This is just the general setup regarding scenes and stuff with placeholder text that we can replace later. I used an old phaser game of mine as the general layout, sooo you might see larry references here and there.

Feel free to go at it, leave notes here or make a separate file idc.
